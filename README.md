# CS-360

**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

This app was designed in order to meet the following user needs:
- A database with at least three tables: one to store the daily weight, one to store user logins and passwords, and one to store the goal weight
(Note that goal weight will be constant, but setting a one-time weight that is stored in a database will be the simplest way for you to accomplish this task.)
- A screen for logging into the app
(Note that the screen for logging into the app should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before.)
- A screen with a grid that displays all the daily weights and the days they were entered
- A mechanism by which the user can add a daily weight
- A mechanism by which the user can add a goal weight
- A mechanism by which the application will notify the user when they reach their goal weight

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

I ended up creating several screens to support user needs, to include a login screen, the main summary screen for weight entry items, a goal screen, a settings screen, an edit screen, and an add weigh-in screen.  
I had several family members test my app and used their feedback to produce my best user-centered UI (within reason) possible, within the scope of the assignment.  My designs were successful because I went through
several iterations of trial and error, making sure to test the functionality of the application thoroughly (again, within the scope of the assignment).

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**

I approached the process of coding my application by using an overwhelming amount of trial and error.  I did what I knew how to do first, and tested often, fixing small errors throughout.
Once it came time to code pieces of the application that I didn't know how to, I stopped and did some research on what the best approach might be for my situation, and learned how to apply that approach.
When that approach inevitably produced more errors, I had to find out why those errors were happening, and correct those.  I am very good at iteration, and it is how I've learned most things throughout my life.
Even when dealing with studying for exams, I produce my own practice exams, and take different random iterations of those exams, which is the best learning process for me by far.  This is the technique I apply 
across the board (with exception to skydiving, it is not wise to fail at skydiving even once).

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**

Every time I added a new function, I would run the application again, and enter anything I could think of that a user might enter.  I used the back function often, and entered many different
forms of information into my app (strings, ints, floats) to try to provoke crashes or errors.  This process is incredibly important, and it revealed several errors in my application, which I added
exception handling for.

**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

In this particular case, because of the extremely small timeframe we had to work in, I had to leave out several unnecessary features of the app in order to meet the user's basic needs (such as 
cosmetic UI tweaks, and some data manipulation).  The timeframe forced me to first, work within my skill set, and then learn only what I needed to in order to meet the user needs inside the given deadline.

**In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I would say that even though I have very limited knowledge, skills, and certainly experience, I demonstrated these values through my attention to detail in designing the app, from the way that
each screen works, to the organization and thorough commenting of the code with timestamps for each and every comment.  Even if the app leaves a great deal to be desired before hitting the market and making even
a single dollar, any developer, even those less experienced than I would be able to seamlessly work on the application.
